What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates an empty, hidden .git file. It's needed to store the commits that you make.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to "prep" files that you want to be committed (it can be one file or multiple files to be committed together). Its value is in the fact that it can divide changes in the working directory into logical commits.
