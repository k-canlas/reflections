When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    You'd want a remote repository if you were to collaborate on something with other people so that there's easy access to the repository     for more than one computer.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Doing it manually allows you to pull changes that are logical rather than at points that you might not want to have pulled yet.
